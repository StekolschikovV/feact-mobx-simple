To get an global overview of how MobX internally works,\n * this is a good place to start:\n * https://medium.com/@mweststrate/becoming-fully-reactive-an-in-depth-explanation-of-mobservable-55995262a254#.xvbh6qd74\n *\n * Source folders:\n * ===============\n *\n * - api/     Most of the public static methods exposed by the module can be found here.\n * - core/    Implementation of the MobX algorithm; atoms, derivations, reactions, dependency trees, optimizations. Cool stuff can be found here.\n * - types/   All the magic that is need to have observable objects, arrays and values is in this folder. Including the modifiers like `asFlat`.\n * - utils/   Utility stuff.\n *\n */\nimport { die } from \"./errors\"\nimport { getGlobal } from \"./utils/global\"\n;[\"Symbol\", \"Map\", \"Set\", \"Symbol\"].forEach(m => {\n    let g = getGlobal()\n    if (typeof g[m] === \"undefined\") {\n        die(`MobX requires global '${m}' to be available or polyfilled`)\n    }\n})\n\nimport { spy, getDebugName, $mobx } from \"./internal\"\n\nexport {\n    IObservable,\n    IDepTreeNode,\n    Reaction,\n    IReactionPublic,\n    IReactionDisposer,\n    untracked,\n    IAtom,\n    createAtom,\n    spy,\n    IComputedValue,\n    IEqualsComparer,\n    comparer,\n    IEnhancer,\n    IInterceptable,\n    IInterceptor,\n    IListenable,\n    IObjectWillChange,\n    IObjectDidChange,\n    isObservableObject,\n    IValueDidChange,\n    IValueWillChange,\n    IObservableValue,\n    isObservableValue as isBoxedObservable,\n    IObservableArray,\n    IArrayWillChange,\n    IArrayWillSplice,\n    IArraySplice,\n    IArrayUpdate,\n    IArrayDidChange,\n    isObservableArray,\n    IKeyValueMap,\n    ObservableMap,\n    IMapEntries,\n    IMapEntry,\n    IMapWillChange,\n    IMapDidChange,\n    isObservableMap,\n    IObservableMapInitialValues,\n    ObservableSet,\n    isObservableSet,\n    ISetDidChange,\n    ISetWillChange,\n    IObservableSetInitialValues,\n    transaction,\n    observable,\n    IObservableFactory,\n    CreateObservableOptions,\n    computed,\n    IComputedFactory,\n    isObservable,\n    isObservableProp,\n    isComputed,\n    isComputedProp,\n    extendObservable,\n    observe,\n    intercept,\n    autorun,\n    IAutorunOptions,\n    reaction,\n    IReactionOptions,\n    when,\n    IWhenOptions,\n    action,\n    isAction,\n    runInAction,\n    IActionFactory,\n    keys,\n    values,\n    entries,\n    set,\n    remove,\n    has,\n    get,\n    apiOwnKeys as ownKeys,\n    apiDefineProperty as defineProperty,\n    configure,\n    onBecomeObserved,\n    onBecomeUnobserved,\n    flow,\n    isFlow,\n    flowResult,\n    FlowCancellationError,\n    isFlowCancellationError,\n    toJS,\n    trace,\n    IObserverTree,\n    IDependencyTree,\n    getDependencyTree,\n    getObserverTree,\n    resetGlobalState as _resetGlobalState,\n    getGlobalState as _getGlobalState,\n    getDebugName,\n    getAtom,\n    getAdministration as _getAdministration,\n    allowStateChanges as _allowStateChanges,\n    runInAction as _allowStateChangesInsideComputed, // This has become the default behavior in Mobx 6\n    Lambda,\n    $mobx,\n    isComputingDerivation as _isComputingDerivation,\n    onReactionError,\n    interceptReads as _interceptReads,\n    IComputedValueOptions,\n    IActionRunInfo,\n    _startAction,\n    _endAction,\n    allowStateReadsStart as _allowStateReadsStart,\n    allowStateReadsEnd as _allowStateReadsEnd,\n    makeObservable,\n    makeAutoObservable,\n    autoAction as _autoAction,\n    AnnotationsMap,\n    AnnotationMapEntry,\n    override\n} from \"./internal\"\n\n// Devtools support\ndeclare const __MOBX_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__: { injectMobx: (any) => void }\nif (typeof __MOBX_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__ === \"object\") {\n    // See: https://github.com/andykog/mobx-devtools/\n    __MOBX_DEVTOOLS_GLOBAL_HOOK__.injectMobx({\n        spy,\n        extras: {\n            getDebugName\n        },\n        $mobx\n    })\n}\n","import { configure } from \"mobx\";\nexport function defaultNoopBatch(callback) {\n    callback();\n}\nexport function observerBatching(reactionScheduler) {\n    if (!reactionScheduler) {\n        reactionScheduler = defaultNoopBatch;\n        if (\"production\" !== process.env.NODE_ENV) {\n            console.warn(\"[MobX] Failed to get unstable_batched updates from react-dom / react-native\");\n        }\n    }\n    configure({ reactionScheduler: reactionScheduler });\n}\nexport var isObserverBatched = function () {\n    if (\"production\" !== process.env.NODE_ENV) {\n        console.warn(\"[MobX] Deprecated\");\n    }\n    return true;\n};\n//# sourceMappingURL=observerBatching.js.map","import { getDependencyTree } from \"mobx\";\nexport function printDebugValue(v) {\n    return getDependencyTree(v);\n}\n//# sourceMappingURL=printDebugValue.js.map","var FinalizationRegistryLocal = typeof FinalizationRegistry === \"undefined\" ? undefined : FinalizationRegistry;\nexport { FinalizationRegistryLocal as FinalizationRegistry };\n//# sourceMappingURL=FinalizationRegistryWrapper.js.map","export function createTrackingData(reaction) {\n    var trackingData = {\n        reaction: reaction,\n        mounted: false,\n        changedBeforeMount: false,\n        cleanAt: Date.now() + CLEANUP_LEAKED_REACTIONS_AFTER_MILLIS\n    };\n    return trackingData;\n}\n/**\n * The minimum time before we'll clean up a Reaction created in a render\n * for a component that hasn't managed to run its effects.
